# Performance Review App
A workflow-driven application for streamlining employee onboarding and commission plan setup with responsive quota allocation and automated communication.

## About This Repository
This Quota Setting App is available for educational and portfolio purposes only, as it represents intellectual work that showcases functionality similar to what I developed during my professional work. This demonstration version does not contain any proprietary data or information and represents a reimplementation of a common business process tool, using only sample data for illustration purposes. For developmental inquiries regarding the interface, please contact edan@analyticintelligencesolutions.com.

# Technical Architecture
### Multi-Interface Design
The portal features distinct operational views customized for different stakeholders in the onboarding process. Management interfaces provide oversight of the entire team's progress, while employee-facing screens focus on personal data verification and sales plan configuration.

### Commission Structure Configuration
The system dynamically guides sales personnel through plan selection and quota distribution. Real-time validation ensures proper allocation across product lines and territories according to business-specific rules, while preventing common configuration errors before they occur.

### Data Synchronization
The app maintains bidirectional synchronization with SharePoint twice daily through Power Automate flows. This ensures preservation of document history and edit tracking while maintaining proper permission controls for sensitive compensation data across all systems.

### Technology Integration
Backend synchronization keeps records updated across organizational systems through scheduled data exchanges. The application features specialized export formatting to match downstream system requirements and maintains detailed audit trails of all configuration changes.

## Responsive Experience
The application implements a sequential verification approach with stage-gating to ensure complete and accurate data collection. Embedded business logic enforces quota distribution requirements while providing flexibility for different sales roles and territories. Communication automation generates contextual notifications based on process milestones, while comprehensive tracking maintains visibility into each employee's progress.

## User Workflows
The system identifies users and presents appropriate interfaces based on organizational role. Managers oversee a comprehensive dashboard of employee status, initiate automated communications, and verify completion of required steps. New employees confirm personal details, select applicable commission structures, and configure quota allocations with built-in validation. All changes are captured with appropriate versioning and security controls.

## Development and Legal
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. No build process is required - simply serve the files locally using a basic HTTP server. Access the development version at localhost:8080 to start exploring the easy-to-use Employee Onboarding interface. Feel free to explore how it works, use it as inspiration, or adapt elements for your own projects. As with any code sample, it's always best to understand the concepts and implement your own solution rather than using it directly in production. If you're inspired by this approach, I encourage you to develop your own unique solution with substantial modifications to both design and implementation.
