# Architecture Overview
## System Architecture
The Quota Setting App combines a streamlined user interface, intelligent data management, and automated communication capabilities to create an efficient onboarding experience for new sales personnel.

The application implements a dual-interface design that presents fundamentally different experiences based on user role. The manager view provides a comprehensive dashboard for tracking multiple employees through each stage of onboarding, while the employee interface offers a guided, step-by-step workflow for completing required setup tasks. Both interfaces share core visual elements but adapt content and controls based on user needs and permissions.

Data handling relies on a hierarchical object model that maintains relationships between employees, their personal information, selected plans, and quota allocations. This structure enforces business rules such as ensuring quota allocations sum to exactly 100%, while supporting flexible plan templates for different sales roles. The application implements optimistic concurrency with lightweight transaction management to handle potential conflicts during synchronization.

Communication automation generates contextual emails at key workflow stages using predefined templates that incorporate employee-specific information. The system maintains a chronological record of all communications, enabling managers to track engagement and schedule appropriate follow-ups for non-responsive team members.

## Data Flow
The onboarding process begins with authentication that establishes user identity and role permissions. For managers, this provides a comprehensive view of their direct reports with filtering capabilities to focus on specific onboarding stages or team members requiring attention.

As managers select an employee record, the system loads detailed information about their current onboarding status, showing which of the five critical process steps have been completed: plan acknowledgement, QST addition, CRC addition, Varicent entry, and final export. In a real implementation, these would be blank upon tool initilization, and then get filled in as process steps are accomplished in and out of the tool. Each step includes validation logic to prevent advancement until required information is complete. The communication workflow allows managers to trigger automated emails with appropriate content based on the employee's current stage.

Employees walk through a guided workflow beginning with self-identification from a pending onboardee list. In a real implementation, an employee would only be able to see and interact with their one singular row on the list with their own data. The system then presents three sequential screens: personal information verification, plan selection, and quota allocation. Each screen implements progressive disclosure, revealing additional options only when prerequisite information is completed. The quota allocation engine dynamically adjusts available options based on the selected plan, enforcing business rules while providing real-time validation.

Data synchronization occurs through simulated endpoints that represent SharePoint integration and Excel export capabilities. The system maintains multiple data representations optimized for different purposes: structured objects for internal processing, flattened records for SharePoint storage, and formatted tables for Excel compatibility. Bidirectional transformation functions ensure consistency when moving between these formats.

## Technical Implementation
Initially, the Quota Setting application was built in Power Apps. In this case, the application employs vanilla JavaScript with a component-based architecture that separates concerns without requiring framework dependencies. Event delegation manages user interactions efficiently, while a custom state management solution ensures UI components remain synchronized with the underlying data model.

The responsive interface combines CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts to adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile devices. Table virtualization optimizes performance when displaying large employee lists by rendering only visible rows. Form interactions implement input validation with debouncing to prevent excessive processing during rapid user entry.

Modal dialogs provide contextual information and workflow isolation for tasks like email composition and export preview. These components implement focus management for accessibility and prevent interaction with the main interface until the modal task is completed or canceled.

The application includes simulated network operations with appropriate loading states and error handling to represent real-world conditions. Asynchronous operations use Promise-based patterns to maintain code readability while supporting complex workflows with multiple dependencies.
